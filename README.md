A simple llvm analyzer to generate dataflow for C/C++ functions.

This is used as the main part of my graduation project.

Thanks for [this repo](https://github.com/k3ut0i/llvm-dataflow-graphs), which provided a simple but complete solution to analyze llvm IR.

The source of documentation (lang:zh-CN) is put into [`doc` branch](https://github.com/sgqy/dataflow-analyzer/tree/doc).
